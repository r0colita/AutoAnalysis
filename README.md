# AutoAnalysis
An artificial intelligence music analysis tool that analyses music (rather than recordings) based on midi files.

## Goals
- Return a flowchart of formal and stylistic analysis of the given midi file
- Consider the most likely analytical decisions through a statistical approach
- Provide information about idiomatic writing of instrumental parts and difficulty

## Data considerations
### Convenience sample
A midi transcription of Czerny's Op. 299 "The School of Velocity" NÂº 1.

### Representative sample
TBD (Review Crash Course: Statistics; Codecademy Fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning course)

## Dependencies
- Mido (for handling MIDI files)
- Music21 (for studying large datasets of music)
